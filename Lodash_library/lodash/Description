lodash_library

In this project, you will be implementing some of the most exciting functionality from the widely-popular lodash.js library. You will be implementing ten methods that add new functionality for numbers, strings, objects, and arrays.

In implementing each method, we will follow these four steps:

1. Specify the functionality of the method we are implementing
2. Ideate a game plan for how to implement this functionality in code
3. Implement our game plan
4. Test our code to ensure it works as expected
